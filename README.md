# Homework Challenge One

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

```
        WHEN I view the source code
          THEN I find semantic HTML elements

        WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
          THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

        WHEN I view the icon and image elements
          THEN I find accessible alt attributes

        WHEN I view the heading attributes
          THEN they fall in sequential order

        WHEN I view the title element
          THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```


## Overview

In this challenge the client asked us to complete the above criteria and make their website run smoothly. Not only did we meet the standards but we left the code cleaner than we found it and improved overall SEO. We did not make any changes to the appearance of the webpage, only to the semantics and structure of the code. Below is a screenshot of the final product.
